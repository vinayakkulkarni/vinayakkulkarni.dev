Publishing & Releasing newer versions of your awesome node apps can be a pain if you're doing it manually by per commit basis.

I'd like to shed some light on publishing apps using release & changelog automation tool created by Aloglia called as - [ship.js â›´](https://github.com/algolia/shipjs)

As per the docs:

### Features
- Automated - Minimize your effort for release and make less mistakes.
- Asynchronous - You don't have to release on your local machine. Do it asynchronously and continue your work.
- Collaborative - Don't sweat it alone. Review the next release on pull request with your colleagues.

So, let's begin...

As before, I'll be using the [v-pip](https://github.com/vinayakkulkarni/v-pip) as a demo project to guide you.

### Step #1

Install ship.js

```bash
npx shipjs setup
```

These are the basically the steps I follow while setting up ship.js

```bash
$ npx shipjs setup                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 [20:20:08]

? What is your base branch?
  This is also called "Default branch".
  You usually merge pull-requests into this branch. main
? Which CI configure? GitHub Actions
? Add manual prepare with issue comment?
  You can create `@shipjs prepare` comment on any issue and then github actions run `shipjs prepare` No
? Schedule your release? No
â€º Installing Ship.js
â€º Adding scripts to package.json
â€º Creating ship.config.js
â€º Creating GitHub Actions configuration

ðŸŽ‰  FINISHED

âœ” Installed shipjs as devDependency.

âœ” Added `release` in `scripts` section of `package.json`.

âœ” No `ship.config.js` required.
  You can learn more about the configuration.
  > https://community.algolia.com/shipjs/guide/useful-config.html

âœ˜ `.github/workflows/shipjs-trigger.yml` already exists.
  You still need to finish setting up GitHub Actions.

### Step #2

Modifying the default `.github/workflows/shipjs-trigger.yml` file.

```yml

name: Ship js trigger
on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - closed
jobs:
  build:
    name: Release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true && startsWith(github.head_ref, 'releases/v')
    steps:
      - name: Checkout ðŸ›Ž
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          ref: main

      - name: Setup node environment ðŸ“¦
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2.1.4
        with:
          registry-url: "https://registry.npmjs.org"

      - name: Install dependencies ðŸ› 
        run: npm ci

      - name: Trigger new release ðŸŽ‰
        run: npx shipjs trigger
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          NPM_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_AUTH_TOKEN }}
          SLACK_INCOMING_HOOK: ${{ secrets.SLACK_INCOMING_HOOK }}
```
