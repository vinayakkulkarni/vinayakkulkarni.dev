## Add Quantitative Statistics — The Single Highest-Lift GEO Change

The GEO paper (arXiv:2311.09735) benchmarked 9 optimization methods across 10K queries. **"Statistics Addition"** — replacing qualitative discussion with concrete numbers wherever possible — was among the top-performing methods, with visibility boosts up to **40%** in generative engine responses. This effect was strongest in factual domains (science, history, finance, health).

LLMs preferentially extract specific, quotable numerical claims because they reduce hallucination risk for the model, anchor the answer to verifiable facts, and provide attribution-friendly snippets the model can cite back to your URL.

**Incorrect (qualitative-only content):**

```vue
<!-- ❌ WRONG — vague, not extractable, no numbers AI can lift -->
<script setup lang="ts">
usePageGeo({
  title: 'Why Nuxt is Fast',
  description: 'Nuxt is one of the fastest frameworks.',
  path: '/blog/nuxt-performance',
})
</script>

<template>
  <article>
    <h1>Why Nuxt is Fast</h1>
    <p>
      Nuxt has become significantly faster in recent years. Many developers
      report better performance and faster builds. The hydration story has
      improved a lot.
    </p>
  </article>
</template>
```

**Correct (statistic-rich content with verifiable numbers):**

```vue
<!-- ✅ CORRECT — every claim has a number an LLM can extract and cite -->
<script setup lang="ts">
usePageGeo({
  title: 'Why Nuxt is Fast',
  description: 'Nuxt 4 ships ~30% smaller hydration payloads and 3-5x faster cold starts on Cloudflare Workers compared to Nuxt 3.',
  path: '/blog/nuxt-performance',
  type: 'Article',
  datePublished: '2026-04-01',
})
</script>

<template>
  <article>
    <h1>Why Nuxt is Fast</h1>
    <p>
      Nuxt 4 ships <strong>~30% smaller hydration payloads</strong> than Nuxt 3
      thanks to selective hydration. On Cloudflare Workers, cold starts dropped
      from <strong>~250ms (Nuxt 3.10)</strong> to <strong>~50-80ms (Nuxt 4.0)</strong>
      — a <strong>3-5x improvement</strong> measured across 1,000 cold invocations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Build times improved by <strong>40-60%</strong> for medium-sized apps
      (200-500 components) after switching from Webpack to Vite + Rolldown.
    </p>
  </article>
</template>
```

### Reusable `<GeoStat>` component (recommended)

Make statistics first-class in your design system so authors stop writing fluff:

```vue
<!-- app/components/Geo/Stat.vue -->
<script setup lang="ts">
defineProps<{
  value: string;       // e.g. "40%", "3.5x", "$2.1B"
  label: string;       // e.g. "visibility lift"
  source?: string;     // e.g. "arXiv:2311.09735"
  sourceUrl?: string;
}>();
</script>

<template>
  <figure class="geo-stat" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Observation">
    <strong itemprop="value">{{ value }}</strong>
    <figcaption itemprop="description">
      {{ label }}
      <a v-if="sourceUrl" :href="sourceUrl" itemprop="citation">— {{ source }}</a>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</template>
```

```vue
<!-- Usage in any page -->
<GeoStat
  value="40%"
  label="visibility lift from adding statistics"
  source="GEO Paper, KDD 2024"
  source-url="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09735"
/>
```

### What counts as a "statistic" for GEO

| Good | Bad |
|------|-----|
| `~40%`, `3.5x`, `$2.1B`, `127ms` | "significantly", "a lot", "many" |
| `7 of 10 developers` | "most developers" |
| `Released 2024-11-15` | "recently released" |
| `Reduced bundle size by 312KB (gzip)` | "smaller bundle" |

### Verification checklist

- [ ] Every paragraph in evergreen content contains at least one concrete number
- [ ] Numbers have units (%, ms, KB, $, x, year)
- [ ] Every statistic has a verifiable source (link or footnote) — see `content-citations`
- [ ] Statistics appear in the **first paragraph** of each section (front-loading helps RAG retrieval)
