## NEVER Bring Classic SEO Keyword Stuffing into GEO

The GEO paper (arXiv:2311.09735) explicitly tested **Keyword Stuffing** as one of its 9 optimization methods. The result: it was **one of the worst-performing strategies**, often producing **negative or near-zero lift** on visibility. This is a **hard reversal** of one of classical SEO's oldest tactics.

Why it fails on generative engines:

1. **LLMs read semantically, not lexically.** Repeating "best Nuxt hosting" 14 times doesn't increase semantic relevance — it just creates a chunk the embedding model treats as low-information.
2. **Stuffed text breaks the "self-contained chunk" principle** (`content-self-contained-chunks`) — the chunk loses meaning when extracted because it's all keyword padding.
3. **Anti-spam classifiers in retrieval pipelines actively downrank** keyword-stuffed pages. Both Perplexity and Google AI Overviews surface this as a quality signal.

**Incorrect (SEO-era keyword stuffing — DO NOT DO THIS):**

```vue
<!-- ❌ WRONG — reads like 2012 SEO; LLMs ignore or downrank this -->
<script setup lang="ts">
usePageSeo({
  title: 'Best Nuxt Hosting | Cheap Nuxt Hosting | Nuxt Hosting Reviews',
  description: 'Looking for the best Nuxt hosting? Compare cheap Nuxt hosting providers. Find affordable Nuxt hosting solutions and Nuxt hosting deals.',
  path: '/best-nuxt-hosting',
})
</script>

<template>
  <article>
    <h1>Best Nuxt Hosting in 2026</h1>
    <p>
      When choosing the best Nuxt hosting, you need a Nuxt hosting provider
      that offers cheap Nuxt hosting with great Nuxt hosting features. Our
      Nuxt hosting reviews compare top Nuxt hosting solutions for Nuxt hosting
      buyers looking for affordable Nuxt hosting in 2026.

    <!-- ...repeated keyword soup... -->
  </article>
</template>
```

**Correct (entity-rich, statistic-backed, naturally varied language):**

```vue
<!-- ✅ CORRECT — names entities once, uses statistics, varies vocabulary -->
<script setup lang="ts">
usePageGeo({
  title: 'Where to Deploy a Nuxt 4 App in 2026 — Cloudflare, Vercel, Netlify, AWS Compared',
  description: 'Cold-start latency, pricing per million requests, and DX comparison for the four most-used deployment targets for Nuxt 4 apps.',

</script>

<template>
  <article>

    <p class="lede">
      Cloudflare Pages leads on cold-start latency (<strong>~50ms</strong>) and
      free-tier generosity. Vercel leads on DX and Nuxt-team coordination.
      Netlify and AWS Amplify trail on both axes for typical Nuxt 4 workloads.
    </p>

    <h2>Cloudflare Pages — best cold-start latency under load</h2>
    <p>
      Cloudflare Pages serves Nuxt 4 apps from <strong>300+ edge locations</strong>
      with median cold starts of <strong>~50ms</strong> measured across 1,000
      synthetic invocations. The free tier includes <strong>100,000 daily
      requests</strong> and unmetered bandwidth.
    </p>

    <h2>Vercel — best DX, tightest Nuxt integration</h2>
    <p>
      Vercel ships first-party Nuxt presets and is co-maintained with the Nuxt
      core team. Cold starts average <strong>~120ms</strong> on the Edge
      Runtime; the Hobby tier covers <strong>100GB-h serverless function
      execution</strong> per month.

### What replaces keyword stuffing for GEO

Classic SEO obsessed over keyword density (1-3%). GEO rewards different signals:

| Old (SEO) | New (GEO) |
|-----------|-----------|
| Repeat target keyword 10-15 times | Mention each entity **once**, use synonyms naturally |
| Long-tail keyword variants in headings | Descriptive declarative headings (see `content-self-contained-chunks`) |
| Keyword in alt text, URL, meta description, H1, H2... | Entity in JSON-LD `Organization` / `Product` (see `entity-organization-schema`) |
| Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) keyword stuffing | Statistics + citations + quotations (the +40% trio) |

### Lexical variety is good — keyword obsession is bad

LLMs reward varied phrasing because it shows the content addresses the topic from multiple angles. Use synonyms:

| Stuffed | Varied (GEO-friendly) |
|---------|----------------------|
| "Nuxt hosting" × 14 | "deploying Nuxt", "Nuxt deployment targets", "where to host a Nuxt 4 app", "production Nuxt infrastructure" |
| "best CRM" × 10 | "leading CRM platforms", "CRM tools for B2B sales", "customer relationship management software" |

### Verification — count keyword density

```bash
# Quick density check — anything over 2-3% on a single phrase is suspect
curl -s https://your-site.com/post | \
  pup 'article text{}' | \
  tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | \
  grep -oE '\bnuxt hosting\b' | \
  wc -l
```

If a single 2-3 word phrase appears more than 3-4 times in a 1,000-word article, rewrite.

### Related anti-patterns to also avoid

- **Doorway pages** (one page per keyword variation) — LLMs deduplicate aggressively; you'll lose all of them
- **Hidden text / `display: none` keyword padding** — modern crawlers strip these
- **AI-generated keyword filler paragraphs** — LLMs detect their own slop and downrank it (yes, really)
