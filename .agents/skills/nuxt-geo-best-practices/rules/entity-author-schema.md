## Person Schema with Credentials and `sameAs` for E-E-A-T

Author identity is the single biggest E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trust) lever for AI search. Generative engines are conservative about citing anonymous content for YMYL (Your Money, Your Life) topics — health, finance, legal, security. They preferentially cite content where the author is a verifiable named entity with credentials.

Adding `Person` JSON-LD with `sameAs` cross-references (LinkedIn, Twitter/X, GitHub, ORCID, scholar profiles) tells the LLM exactly who wrote the content and lets it corroborate that person's expertise from multiple sources.

**Incorrect (no author entity):**

```vue
<!-- ❌ WRONG — article with anonymous author or "by Admin" -->
<template>
  <article>
    <h1>How to Mitigate XSS in Nuxt 4</h1>
    <p class="byline">By Admin · Published April 1, 2026</p>
    <!-- ... -->
  </article>
</template>
```

**Correct (article + author Person schema):**

```vue
<!-- ✅ CORRECT — full author entity with credentials and sameAs -->
<script setup lang="ts">
const post = {
  title: 'How to Mitigate XSS in Nuxt 4',
  description: 'Practical guide to preventing cross-site scripting in Nuxt 4 apps using CSP, sanitization, and Vue\'s built-in defenses.',
  datePublished: '2026-04-01T10:00:00Z',
  dateModified: '2026-04-15T14:30:00Z',
  url: 'https://example.com/blog/xss-in-nuxt-4',
};

const author = {
  name: 'Jane Doe',
  jobTitle: 'Principal Security Engineer',
  worksFor: 'My App, Inc.',
  url: 'https://janedoe.dev',

useHead({
  script: [
    {
      type: 'application/ld+json',
      innerHTML: JSON.stringify({
        '@context': 'https://schema.org',
        '@type': 'Article',
        headline: post.title,

        mainEntityOfPage: post.url,
        author: {

    </p>
    <!-- article body -->

```

### Module-based — `nuxt-schema-org`

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
useSchemaOrg([
  defineArticle({
    headline: post.title,
    description: post.description,
    datePublished: post.datePublished,
    dateModified: post.dateModified,
    author: definePerson({
      name: author.name,
      jobTitle: author.jobTitle,
      url: author.url,
      sameAs: author.sameAs,
      knowsAbout: author.knowsAbout,
    }),
  }),
]);
</script>
```

### Author bio page — the canonical Person URL

Each author should have a dedicated `/about/jane-doe` page that **also** emits the full `Person` schema. This becomes the canonical entity URL that other articles reference via `@id`:

```vue
<!-- pages/about/[author].vue -->
<script setup lang="ts">
const route = useRoute();
const author = await fetchAuthor(route.params.author as string);

useSchemaOrg([
  definePerson({
    '@id': `https://example.com/about/${author.slug}#person`,
    name: author.name,
    jobTitle: author.jobTitle,
    url: `https://example.com/about/${author.slug}`,
    image: author.headshot,
    description: author.bio,
    sameAs: author.sameAs,
    knowsAbout: author.expertiseAreas,
    alumniOf: author.education,
    award: author.awards,
  }),
]);
</script>
```

### What goes in `knowsAbout`

This is the LLM's strongest topical authority signal for an author. Be specific:

| Vague (low GEO value) | Specific (high GEO value) |
|----------------------|---------------------------|
| "Programming" | "Vue.js", "Nuxt 4", "TypeScript", "Vite plugin development" |
| "Marketing" | "B2B SaaS positioning", "PLG conversion optimization", "developer relations" |
| "AI" | "Retrieval-augmented generation", "transformer architecture", "LLM fine-tuning" |

### YMYL extra requirements

For health, finance, legal, security topics — go further:

- Add `hasCredential` with the actual certification:
  ```ts
  hasCredential: {
    '@type': 'EducationalOccupationalCredential',
    credentialCategory: 'Professional Certification',
    name: 'CISSP',
    recognizedBy: { '@type': 'Organization', name: 'ISC²' },
  }
  ```
- Link to a published bio with photo on a separate URL
- Cross-reference at minimum: LinkedIn, primary employer page, one third-party publication (book, peer-reviewed paper, named industry talk)
- For health/medical: link to PubMed author profile or NPI registry

### Verify

```bash
# 1. Schema validates
curl -s https://example.com/blog/your-post | \
  pup 'script[type="application/ld+json"] text{}' | \
  jq '.author'

# 2. Cross-references resolve and link back
# Manually verify: does janedoe.dev mention "My App, Inc."?
# Does linkedin.com/in/janedoe list "My App" as employer?
# These two-way links are what AI systems corroborate.
```

### Anti-patterns

- **Pen names without identity verification** — LLMs heavily downrank pseudonymous YMYL content. Use real names or accept the cost.
- **Multiple aliases for the same author across articles** — pick one canonical name per author and stick to it
- **AI-written content attributed to a human** — when LLMs detect the mismatch (perplexity, sentence-length distribution, Burstiness), they downrank the entire site
